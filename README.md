# Convection and Diffusion PDE Project
## About this project
A laboratory project part of a course in  analytic and numerical methods for partial differential equations at KTH

In this assignment, various numerical methods are applied to solve partial differential equations related to convection and diffusion. The tasks include
1. Find an analytic solution of an equation using characteristics.
2. Simmulate smoke production and wind from data.
3. Compare the finite difference method and approximation with Fourier series as solution methods.
4. Solving the problem using random walk with Monte Carlo sampling.

(The MATLAB files for assignment 4 are not included in this repo since the code for the simulation isn't written by me).
